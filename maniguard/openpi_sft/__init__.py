"""ManiGuard pi0.5 LoRA SFT task configs for the openpi-native trainer.

This package defines the task DataConfigs / policies / TrainConfigs and, at
import time, inserts the TrainConfigs into openpi's ``_CONFIGS_DICT`` via
:func:`train_configs.register`. openpi's own source is not modified — the
configs simply attach to its registry.

The launchers in ``tools/openpi_sft/`` import this package first (triggering the
registration below) and then hand off to openpi's own
``scripts/train.py`` / ``scripts/compute_norm_stats.py`` — so all the heavy
lifting (data loading, model, norm-stats, training loop) stays in openpi and we
only contribute the task-specific config.
